    "### Methodology:\n",
    "1. The power usage models from Step 1 were used to predict power based on the GPH of each machine.\n",
    "2. The objective was to minimize total power consumption while meeting the total GPH requirement of 9,000.\n",
    "3. The optimization used Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) with constraints.\n",
    "4. The final result gives the GPH value for each machine that balances production needs with power efficiency.\n",
    "5. This approach ensures that all machines operate within their allowed GPH ranges."
